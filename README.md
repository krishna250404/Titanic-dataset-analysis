only about 38% of passangers survived indicating a strong class imbalance.

# 2. Survival rate by gender
<img src = "visuals/malevsfemalesurvival.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Female passangers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

# 3. Survival rate by passanger class
<img src = "visuals/passengerclasssurvival.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Survival rate increased substantially with passanger class.

# 4. Survival rate by gender and class
<img src = "visuals/survival_by_gender_and_class.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
First class women had the highest survival rate while third class men had the lowest survival rate.

# 5 Age distribution by survival status
