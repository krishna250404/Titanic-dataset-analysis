# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project overview
An exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand key factors that influenced passenger survival.

# 1. Overall survival distribution
<img src = "visuals/survivalcountplot.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
only about 38% of passangers survived indicating a strong class imbalance.

# 2. Survival rate by gender
<img src = "visuals/malevsfemalesurvival.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Female passangers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

# 3. Survival rate by passanger class
<img src = "visuals/passengerclasssurvival.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Survival rate increased substantially with passanger class.

# 4. Survival rate by gender and class
<img src = "visuals/survival_by_gender_and_class.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
First class women had the highest survival rate while third class men had the lowest survival rate.

# 5. Age distribution by survival status
<img src = "visuals/age_distribution_by_survival.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Younger passengers showed higher survival likelihood.

# 6. Survival by family size
<img src = "visuals/survival_by_family_size.png" height = 300px width = 300px>
Passengers travelling with small families had better survival outcomes.

## Conclusion
Survival on titanic was strongly influenced by gender and passenger class, with age, and family size also playing meaningful roles.
